# hitif-dlseg-pipeline

The Snakemake pipeline for HiTIF nuclei segmentation shown below is a configurable workflow to evaluate any number of different nuclear instance segmentation models. The pipeline executes these tasks: pre-processing/augmentation, training, inference, and evaluation. Essential processes (e.g. computation) and outputs (e.g., models, images) of the pipeline are shown below.

Each task is configured by a set of input files and parameters, by a call to a bash or a Python script that accepts the input
files and processes them, and by a set of output files generated by the task.

The required configuration for the pipeline is:

1. Set of training experiments/images to be used to train the model
2. Set of test experiments/images to be used in inference and evaluation
3. Configuration of the augmentation/pre-processing pipeline for input experiments
4. Configuration of MRCNN model training
5. Configuration of FPN models training
