# Inference of Cell Object Detection and Segmentation
This is an inference implementation on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), ResNet101, MRCNN, Gaussian Blurred border, and Distance Map model.

The folder includes:
* Jupyter notebooks of inference built on [MRCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).
* Jupyter notebooks of inference built on Gaussian Blurred border and Distance Map Models.
